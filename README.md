# PSharp
Advanced &amp; easy to use version of C-Sharp for people who can't code properly in C#. This is just a simple project so therefore it's not entirely possible to make a complete powerful software using this. 

# How-to-install
To install PSharp (Poseidon Sharp), you can download the .ZIP/RAR file form the releases tab and drag n drop them to your Project's folder (Not the output folder). Make sure to include "using P_Sharp;". Please remember that PSharp is only made for C#.

# Preview Build
To access the beta build, you can always download it from here but since it's not released you cannot download the beta version.
