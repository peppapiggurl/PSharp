# PSharp
Advanced &amp; easy to use version of C-Sharp for people who can't code properly in C#. This is just a simple project so therefore it's not entirely possible to make a complete powerful software using this. 

# How-to-install
Installing PSharp is very easy. Go to the releases tab and download the "PSharp.CS" file and then go to Visual Studio and create a new Winforms project (This is only supported in Winforms for now otherwise you'll get annoying errors). Then right click on the solution and press "Add" > "Add existing file" and then select the PSharp.CS file and you are ready to use PSharp by using "using P_Sharp;"!

# Preview Build
Please go to the releases tab > download the PSharp.CS file and then add it to your project.

# What is this made for
Please understand that PSharp was originally made for ROBLOX exploits because we develop ROBLOX exploits. We've been noticing people struggling with basic C# so we've decided to make this masterpiece for you, and for everyone.
